for 0.73:

Just look at the links to figure out how to get your patch files. It's really hard to describe, but very easy to comprehend.

When you download the patch file, download it to your maplestory directory.

3. Edit the batch file so the third argument has the same name as the patch file you downloaded. Make sure the second argument is "read"
4. Run the batch file. All of the new files created by NXPatcher will be placed in the "Patcher" directory.
5. Copy the files from your "Patcher" directory to your Maplestory directory. You are now fully patched.
